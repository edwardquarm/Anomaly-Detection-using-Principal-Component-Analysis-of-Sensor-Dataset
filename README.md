## Motivation

There is a need to identify abnormalities in sensor data from equipment so as to predict faults in equipments way before they break down.
This project uses statistics concepts such as mean and variance to build  a fault detection algorithm using a sliding window that learns from the sensor data and makes prediction on possible faults.
