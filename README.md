## Motivation

There is a need to identify abnormalities in sensor data from equipment so as to predict faults in equipments way before they break down.
This project uses machine learning algorithm; Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for a fault detection system for a sensors network measuring air pollutants and to localize on line the faulty sensor. 


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* jupyter notebook

Code is written in:
* Python

Methods used are:
* Principal Component Analysis
* Data Visualization


## Dataset
The dataset for this project is 2 csv files:

* Normaloperation.csv

* Faultyoperation.csv

The csv files is formed by 18 rows, the first 3 rows correspond to measurements of ozon, nitrogen oxyde and dioxide on the first location, the 3 following rows to the measurements on the second location and so on.
